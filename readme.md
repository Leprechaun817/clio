# Clio

Clio is a minimalist alternative to the feature bloat of many argument-parsing libraries.

Clio supports long and short-form options and arbitrarily-nested commands. It aims to provide an elegant, consistent interface accross multiple programming languages, implemented wherever possible as a simple drop-in file.

Clio is named for the Command Line Interface Olympian, quondam Muse of the historians, which is where she learned all about handling arguments.
