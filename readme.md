# Clio

A minimalist argument-parsing library for building elegant command-line interfaces.

Clio supports long and short-form options and arbitrarily-nested commands. It aims to provide a consistent interface across multiple programming languages, implemented wherever possible as a simple drop-in file.

Clio is currently an alpha-stage project. It works, but it lacks documentation and real-world testing, and its interface remains subject to change.
