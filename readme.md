# Clio

Clio is a minimalist, multi-language argument-parsing library designed for
building elegant command-line interfaces.

* Clio supports long and short-form options and arbitrarily-nested commands.

* Clio aims to present a consistent interface across multiple programming
  languages, implemented wherever possible as a simple drop-in file.

* Clio is currently implemented in C, Go, Java, and Python.

See the [documentation][docs] for further details.
