# Clio

Clio is a minimalist argument-parsing library designed for building elegant command-line interfaces.

Clio supports long and short-form options and arbitrarily-nested commands. It aims to provide a consistent interface across multiple programming languages, implemented wherever possible as a simple drop-in file.

Clio is currently implemented in C, Go, Java, and Python. See the [documentation][docs] for details.
